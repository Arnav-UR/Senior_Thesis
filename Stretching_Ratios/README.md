This directory contains results for the stretching ratio for each set of simulations (impact angle 0 to 90 degrees for each impactor to total mass ratio). 
Each set has a text file named for the first simulation in the set, which contains relevant values, as well as a plot of the data. We have total plots for our data as well as the secondary impact data.
